# vantage
A developer's build tool/task runner that cares for your environment.

vantage will run the command you give it with environment variables set as you need them. Turning complex commands into re-usable "task" scripts is easy. Switching between environments and running those tasks is easy too. Running tasks inside docker containers is what vantage does best.
