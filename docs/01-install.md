# Install

Download the latest release from GitHub and untar/unzip it. There's an `install.sh` script in there that will show you a
fairly standard way to install vantage.

It's a fairly plain install process, you download the binaries somewhere, then put a symlink to them on your PATH. We 
like to keep vantage installed in `/usr/local/vantage` and we symlink `/usr/local/vantage/vantage` to 
`/usr/local/bin/vantage` and `/usr/local/bin/vg`.
